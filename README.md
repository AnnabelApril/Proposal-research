# Proposal-research
The question I want to propose for research is:

from which time does internet stop being referred to as "the internet" in the available literature

The method I will be using is partly the Google tool Ngram viewer and also specific tekst analysis in command line.
I find this to be an intersesting shift and I associate this with the integration of internet in society. 
With this research I will find if this is the case or if there are different factors that play a part 
With the acquired data I will frase a conclusion
