# Proposal-research
The question I am proposing for research is:

from which time does internet stop being referred to as "the internet" in the available literature

The method I will be using is partly the Google tool Ngram viewer and also specific tekst analysis in command line.  
I find this to be an intersesting shift and I associate this with the integration of internet in society.    
With the acquired data I will phrase a conclusion
